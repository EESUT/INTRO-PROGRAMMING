## Hi the course, register in quera.ir

In this course your HWs and final project will be available on quera.ir.
So, first of all make a quera account. please fill you account information correctly, and use your student id for your account number. 
Also please do not change your information during the course.

#### What is programming language?
In this course we are going to use C++ as our programming language. 
A computer program (also commonly called an application) is a set of instructions that the computer can perform in order to perform some task. The process of creating a program is called programming. Programmers typically create programs by producing source code (commonly shortened to code), which is a list of commands typed into one or more text files.

The collection of physical computer parts that make up a computer and execute programs is called the hardware. When a computer program is loaded into memory and the hardware sequentially executes each instruction, this is called running or executing the program.

### Why c++?
C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few common types of applications that most likely would be written in C++:

- Video games
- Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…)
- High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
- Graphical applications and simulations
- Productivity / office applications
- Embedded software
- Audio and video processing
- Artificial intelligence and neural networks

## IDE and "Hello World!"
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a piece of software that contains all of the things you need to develop, compile, link, and debug your programs.

With a typical C++ IDE, you get a code editor that does line numbering and syntax highlighting. Many (but not all) IDEs include a C++ compiler and a linker, which the IDE will know how to interface with in order to convert your source code into an executable file. And when you need to debug your program, you can use the integrated debugger.

Furthermore, IDEs typically bundle a number of other helpful editing features, such as integrated help, name completion, auto-formatting, and sometimes a version control system. So while you could do all of these things separately, it’s much easier to install an IDE and have them all accessible from a single interface.

So let’s install one! The obvious next question is, “which one?”. Many IDEs are free (in price), and you can install multiple IDEs if you wish, so there’s no “wrong decision” to be made here.

In this course we are going to officially use **Code::Blocks** IDE.
You also need to install our own designed version of SDL for doing jobs related to graphics and your final project. TAs will help you in this part, so feel free to ask them for help. You can also check

for installation instruction.

Then, when you make an cpp code, you will see some code like this :
``` cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    // insert code here...
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
    return 0;
}
```
when you run this code, the code will print "Hello, World!" on your terminal.
